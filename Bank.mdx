description: "After successfully completing identity (KYC) verification, users must undergo bank account verification to activate fiat deposit and redemption functions. This ensures that the CNHO platform only interacts with legitimate, user-owned offshore RMB accounts."

### 🔐 **What You Can Do After Bank Verification**

- ✅ **Deposit CNH** to receive CNHO stablecoins
- ✅ **Transfer and withdraw** funds
- ⚠️ **Redemption (Convert CNHO to fiat)** requires a separate **Initialization step** (covered in the next guide)

> You may register multiple bank accounts, but only **one** can be set as your **default withdrawal account**.

- Be **owned by you**, matching the full legal name from your KYC
- Be able to **send and receive CNH (offshore RMB)** via wire transfer
