The CNHO Stables faucet allows users to request **free test CNHO tokens** on the **testnet** or **devnet**. These tokens are primarily for **developers**, **testers**, or early community onboarding — they have no monetary value.

## 💡 Troubleshooting

| Issue                           | Solution                                                         |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Faucet says "Address not valid" | Make sure it's a **Cosmos-based address**, not Ethereum.         |
| Tokens not arriving             | Check if you're on the right network (**testnet**, not mainnet). |
| Rate-limited                    | Wait 24 hours before requesting again.                           |
| Need more tokens for testing    | Ask in the CNHO Discord community.                               |
