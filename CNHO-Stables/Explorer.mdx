## 🛡 Tips for a Safe Staking Experience

- **Use any of the three explorers** listed above — they are fully compatible with Keplr and Leap.
- **Leave at least 0.1 CNHO** unstaked to cover gas.
- **Monitor validator performance** (downtime, commission, slashing).
- **Claim rewards regularly** — they do not auto-compound.
- **Unstaking takes 21 days** before your tokens become available again.
