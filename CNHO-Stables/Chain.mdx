description: "Introduction to CNHO Stables Chain."
---

CNHO Stables Chain is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain network built on the **Cosmos SDK** framework, specifically optimized to support the Offshore Chinese Yuan (CNHO) stablecoin ecosystem. The chain is designed with a primary focus on stablecoin use cases, providing high performance, security, and scalability.

---

## Core Features and Parameters

- **Blockchain Framework:**\
  Built on the **Cosmos SDK**, leveraging the modular and interoperable architecture of the Cosmos ecosystem.
- **Token Details:**
  - **Token Name:** CNHO
  - **Token Denomination:** CNHO
  - **Minimum Unit:** ucnho (micro CNHO)
  - **Conversion:** 1 CNHO = 1,000,000 ucnho
  - **Initial Total Supply:** 1.3 billion CNHO (1,300,000,000 CNHO)
- **Node Capacity:**\
  The network supports up to **200 validator nodes**, enabling decentralization while maintaining high throughput.

---

## Consensus and Network Parameters

- **Consensus Mechanism:**\
  Uses **Tendermint-based Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)** consensus with a set of elected validators responsible for block production and transaction finality.
- **Block Time:**\
  Approximately **6 seconds** per block to balance speed and network stability.
- **Validators:**
  - **Active Validators:** Around 40 active validators securing the network at any time.
  - **Commission Rate:** Varies from 5% to 15%, set by individual validators to cover operational costs and rewards.
- **Staking:**\
  Token holders delegate CNHO to validators, securing the network and earning proportional staking rewards.
- **Signed Block Window:**\
  The **Signed Block Window** is set to **20,000 blocks**, meaning validator signing behavior is monitored over this window to determine their uptime and eligibility, affecting slashing and rewards.

---

## Reward and Governance Model

- **Transaction Fees:** Fees for transactions and operations paid in CNHO, distributed to validators and delegators.
- **Block Rewards:** Additional rewards issued as OFO governance tokens, approximately 2 OFO tokens rewarded per block.
- **Governance:**\
  OFO tokens enable decentralized governance of protocol parameters and upgrades.

---

## Network Performance and Security

- **Transaction Throughput:** High TPS enabled by Cosmos SDK and Tendermint consensus.
- **Network Security:** High validator uptime (\>99%) and slashing penalties promote validator reliability and security.
