To send the CNHO token using the Phantom wallet on the Solana network, follow these detailed steps:

**Step 1: Ensure You Have the Phantom Wallet Installed**

First, make sure you have the Phantom wallet installed as a browser extension or mobile application. If you haven’t done this yet, visit [<u>Phantom’s official website</u>](https://phantom.app/) to download and install it.

**Step 2: Create or Import Your Wallet**

If you are new to Phantom, create a new wallet by following the prompts. If you already have a wallet, import it using your seed phrase. Ensure that your wallet is properly set up and secured.

**Step 3: Add CNHO Token to Your Wallet**

Before sending CNHO tokens, ensure that they are visible in your Phantom wallet. If they are not automatically displayed:

- Click on “Manage Tokens” in your wallet.
- Search for “CNHO” or enter its token address if necessary.
- Add it to your wallet so that you can see your balance.

**Step 4: Prepare to Send Tokens**

Once you have confirmed that the CNHO token is in your wallet:

- Click on the “Send” button within your Phantom wallet interface.
- Enter the recipient’s Solana address (ensure this address is correct to avoid loss of funds).

**Step 5: Specify Amount and Confirm Transaction**

- Input the amount of CNHO tokens you wish to send.
- Review all details carefully, including recipient address and amount.
- Click “Next” or “Confirm” to proceed with the transaction.

**Step 6: Complete the Transaction**

After confirming, wait for the transaction to be processed. You will receive a notification once it has been successfully sent. You can also check the transaction status on a Solana blockchain explorer by entering your transaction ID.

**Step 7: Verify Receipt of Tokens**

Finally, ask the recipient to confirm that they have received the CNHO tokens in their own Phantom wallet.

By following these steps, you can successfully send CNHO tokens using your Phantom wallet on the Solana network.
