**2.1 The U.S. Dollar Monopoly in the Global Stablecoin Market**

As the core infrastructure of on-chain finance, stablecoins have become increasingly critical in recent years—playing essential roles in trading, payments, lending, clearing, and asset issuance. However, the current market structure is heavily unbalanced: USD-pegged stablecoins dominate the entire ecosystem. The two major players, USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle), together account for over 90% of the global stablecoin market by total capitalization, and they command an overwhelming share of trading volume on both decentralized and centralized exchanges.

According to Q4 2024 data, the total global stablecoin market stands at approximately \$135 billion, distributed as follows:

l USDT: ~70%, backed by dollar deposits and short-term U.S. Treasury bills

l USDC: ~20%, fully collateralized by U.S. dollar assets under U.S. regulatory oversight

l Other USD-backed stablecoins (e.g., TUSD, FDUSD) comprise the remainder

By contrast, non-USD stablecoins remain extremely scarce. For example, euro-based stablecoins like EURT and yen-based stablecoins like GYEN have a combined market cap of under \$500 million, accounting for less than 0.5% of the total stablecoin supply. RMB-pegged stablecoins, such as CNYT, are practically invisible in terms of liquidity and adoption.

This over-dollarization runs contrary to the decentralization and diversity that blockchain ecosystems are supposed to represent. The blockchain economy today is overexposed to a single sovereign currency, making it vulnerable to U.S. monetary policy, enforcement, and geopolitical decisions.

Moreover, most major stablecoin issuers are based in the United States, exposing them to intense regulatory pressure. Since 2023, U.S. sanctions and enforcement actions against crypto have escalated. Multiple DeFi protocols have been forced to block specific wallet addresses, and USDC has proactively frozen on-chain assets. For developers and projects operating in emerging markets, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and beyond, such risks have become a serious point of concern.

Thus, “de-dollarization” is not just a theme in traditional geopolitics—it is becoming a critical issue in blockchain finance as well. There is an urgent need for a new class of community-governed stablecoins that reflect regional economic realities, reduce exposure to U.S. jurisdiction, and offer credible alternatives to dollar-based systems.

**2.2 The Rise of the Offshore Renminbi (CNH)**

The renminbi (RMB), as the monetary foundation of the world’s second-largest economy, has long entered the deep waters of internationalization. Since 2009, China has progressively built out its offshore RMB market infrastructure, forming a global clearing network based on CNH (offshore RMB).

Unlike CNY (onshore RMB), CNH is not subject to China’s capital controls, and can be freely traded and settled in major financial centers such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and London. It already operates within a mature interbank clearing and foreign exchange market.

The global influence of CNH is steadily rising:

l SWIFT data ranks RMB as the 4th most-used currency in global payments

l The IMF has included RMB in the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket, signaling its global reserve currency status

l In 2023, over 30% of China–ASEAN cross-border settlements were executed in CNH

l The RMB's share in trade settlements with the Middle East, Russia, and Africa is also growing rapidly

This indicates that while CNH is not yet a universal legal tender, it has already assumed a major role in real-world trade, settlement, and capital flows. CNH combines the sovereign backing of the renminbi with the flexibility and freedom of market-based operations, making it a promising candidate for on-chain value representation.

**2.3 Why Blockchain Needs a CNH Stablecoin**

The emergence of CNH opens new possibilities for the crypto world. Compared to the U.S. dollar, CNH offers several unique advantages that make it ideal for a blockchain-native stablecoin:

l Strong regional relevance: As a key trade settlement currency in Asia, CNH better reflects the real economic needs of East and Southeast Asia.

l Resilience against financial decoupling risks: As a non-U.S. currency, CNH provides a hedge against sanctions, blacklisting, or regulatory disruption from the U.S.

l Significant market gap: There is currently no widely adopted, community-governed CNH stablecoin with real liquidity and trust.

l Unlocks new cross-border use cases: Such as SME trade finance, localized DeFi pricing, and regional Web3 payroll and treasury operations.

In this context, CNHO is not a simple technical wrapper for CNH, but rather a new experiment in decentralized stablecoin design—rooted in CNH as a base value layer, governed by blockchain consensus, and executed through open-source and transparent architecture.

It reflects a shift toward a more multipolar, region-driven global financial order, and creates new opportunities for Asia-based users and developers to participate in, build, and shape the future of crypto-powered economies.
