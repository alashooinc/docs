**Introduction**

Stablecoins serve as a bridge between blockchain networks and the real-world economy. They play a pivotal role in the crypto asset ecosystem—not only as units of account and trading pairs, but also as core instruments for value storage, payment settlement, and price stability.

At present, the global stablecoin market is overwhelmingly dominated by the U.S. dollar. USDT and USDC together account for over \$120 billion in market capitalization, making up more than 90% of the entire stablecoin sector. This monopolistic reliance on a single currency framework ties the blockchain economy tightly to U.S. monetary policy and regulatory risks. For regions and communities seeking diverse financial sovereignty, this poses a significant and growing concern.

It is within this context that CNHO (Offshore China Yuan) was born.

CNHO is a decentralized stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the offshore renminbi (CNH). It is designed to offer a regional crypto asset alternative—one that does not rely on the U.S. dollar, centralized custodians, or government backing. CNHO is issued and governed by OffshoreDAO, and is entirely built on blockchain-native technologies and community-driven governance. Its price stability is maintained through multi-asset on-chain collateralization and supported by decentralized oracle feeds.

The offshore RMB (CNH) has been active in global markets for over a decade. It offers higher liquidity, transparency, and freedom of movement compared to the onshore RMB (CNY), which remains under the control of the People’s Bank of China. CNH is actively used in financial centers such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and London. CNHO combines CNH’s global liquidity with the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, creating a trustless cryptographic version of CNH designed to serve users and developers across the Asia-Pacific region.

**CNHO Use Cases：**

l Unit of account for regional DeFi: Provides a familiar, stable, and non-USD alternative for Asia-Pacific protocols and users.

l Stable income tool for Web3 developers and creators: Enables DAOs and open-source communities to pay contributors in CNH terms.

l Cross-border settlement channel for SMEs: Especially useful in Southeast Asia and Greater China trade contexts.

l Collateral and liquidation unit for on-chain leveraged assets: A CNH-denominated standard for DeFi lending and risk management.

Beyond being a stablecoin, CNHO is also a community-led experiment in monetary governance. While traditional currency policies are determined by sovereign states via central banks, CNHO’s monetary parameters—including collateral ratios, liquidation rules, oracle configuration, bridge strategies, and supply controls—are all decided by holders of the \$OFO governance token via OffshoreDAO.

This means CNHO is not controlled by any single company or development team. It is collectively owned and governed by its participants. Such an open governance structure promises to build a more resilient, transparent, and community-aligned financial system.

We believe that the internationalization of the renminbi is not solely a state-led monetary strategy—it can also be a decentralized experiment in technology and trust, led by a global Web3-native community.

CNHO is not a replication of central bank functions. Rather, it is a complementary alternative: a decentralized offshore RMB system running on cryptographic consensus and smart contract logic. It offers a new model of value stability—originating from the East, and representative of emerging regional economic aspirations.

Our goal is not to compete with USDT or USDC, but to build a stable, open value anchor for the next generation of on-chain economies—born in, built for, and understood through the context of Asia.
