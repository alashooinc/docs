### Why Use a Smaller Unit Like mBTC?

Bitcoin (BTC) is a highly valuable digital asset, and its price per coin can be quite high, making it impractical for many users to trade or transact with whole BTC units, especially for smaller amounts. To facilitate easier, more accessible trading and payments, Bitcoin is often subdivided into smaller units.

- **More Granularity:** Using smaller units like mBTC (milli-Bitcoin) allows for finer granularity in pricing and trading.
- **Lower Barriers:** It lowers the entry barrier for traders and investors who may not want or afford to buy a whole BTC.
- **Improved User Experience:** Smaller units make it easier to quote prices and execute transactions that align better with users' budgets or trading strategies.
- **Market Standard:** Many platforms and wallets support subunits to improve liquidity and usability.

### What is mBTC?

- **Definition:** 1 mBTC equals 0.001 BTC (one thousandth of a Bitcoin).
- **Conversion:** Therefore, 1 BTC = 1000 mBTC.

This subdivision makes trading and pricing more flexible and convenient, especially in markets where Bitcoinâ€™s high value might deter smaller trades.
