### ðŸ“Š Fee Structure

| Category        | Fee Rate                           | Fee Token | Minimum Fee |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------- | :-------- | :---------- |
| **Trading Fee** | **0.01% (0.0001)** of trade amount | CNHO      | **30 CNHO** |

- **Fees are charged on both sides** of the trade: **buyers and sellers**
- Fees are **always deducted in CNHO**

### ðŸ“Œ Important Rules

1. **Minimum Fee**\
   If 0.01% of your trade amount is **less than 30 CNHO**, you will still be charged **30 CNHO**.
2. **Fee Deduction Logic**
   - **Buy Orders**:\
     CNHO fee is deducted **upfront**, and the **net amount** is used to execute the trade.
   - **Sell Orders**:\
     After the trade is executed, the **fee is deducted from the CNHO you receive**, and you get the **net amount**.
3. **Insufficient CNHO Balance**
   - If your CNHO balance is **not sufficient** to cover the fee, **you will not be able to place the order**.
   - Make sure your account holds **at least 30 CNHO** before submitting a trade.
