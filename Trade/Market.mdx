### 1. **Our Market Philosophy**

At CNHO Stables, our core principle for selecting trading pairs is to feature tokens that possess **intrinsic blockchain value** and genuinely reflect the **fundamental developments of their respective industries**.

We carefully curate trading pairs to ensure each token:

- Represents a meaningful and established blockchain project
- Has demonstrated real-world utility or strong ecosystem adoption
- Reflects key trends and growth within the blockchain and digital asset space
- Aligns with the vision of a sustainable and compliant financial ecosystem

This value-driven approach fosters a robust, forward-looking trading environment supporting the broader adoption of blockchain innovations.

### 3. **Order Types and Features**

Currently, CNHO trading supports **spot trading only**, which enables users to buy or sell assets for immediate settlement.

We offer two primary order types:

- **Market Orders:**\
  Executed immediately at the best available market price, prioritizing speed and guaranteed execution. Ideal for users wanting to quickly enter or exit a position.
- **Limit Orders:**\
  Allows specifying an exact price at which to buy or sell. Execution occurs only if the market reaches the specified price or better. This provides pricing control but may require waiting.

**Why Spot Trading with Market and Limit Orders?**

- **Simplicity and Transparency:** Spot trading deals with the actual asset instantly.
- **Control vs Speed:** Market orders offer fast execution; limit orders offer price precision.
- **Risk Management:** Users balance immediate execution against price control.
- **Market Efficiency:** These order types maintain liquidity and balanced trading activity.
