title: "Initialization Of CNH"
description: "Important Step to Unlock Fiat Redemption"
---

To ensure the safety and success of fiat redemptions, **users must complete an Initialization step** after passing KYC and bank account verification.

This process confirms that your verified bank account **can correctly receive CNH (offshore RMB)** before redemptions are enabled.

---

### ⚠️ Why Is Initialization Required?

Some users may add bank accounts that, despite appearing valid, **cannot actually receive CNH transfers** due to local restrictions or intermediary bank issues.\
To avoid failed settlements, **CNHO requires a real test transaction** in the form of an **initial CNHO acquiring**.

---

### ✅ What You Need Before Initialization

You must first:

1. **Complete KYC Verification**
2. **Add and Verify a Bank Account that supports CNH**

Only then can you proceed with Initialization.

---

### 💰 Step-by-Step: Complete Initialization via CNHO Acquiring

#### **Step 1: Prepare a Minimum Acquiring Amount**

- You must acquire at least **100,000 CNH** (offshore RMB)
- This confirms your account can both **send** and **receive** CNH

#### **Step 2: Follow the CNHO Acquiring Procedure**

- Please follow the official CNHO-CNH **Acquiring** Guide.

This includes:

- Generating a unique deposit instruction
- Sending the CNH transfer from your verified bank account
- Receiving CNHO tokens into your wallet

> ⏳ Typical processing time: 1–2 business days

---

### ✅ After Successful Initialization

Once your first CNHO acquiring is completed:

- 🎉 **Redemption Functionality Will Be Unlocked**
- You will be able to:
  - Convert CNHO back to fiat CNH
  - Use your verified bank account for full on/off-ramp

### 🛡️ Important Notes

- Initialization only needs to be done **once per user**, not per bank account
- The **minimum of 100,000 CNH** is mandatory for unlocking redemptions
- If the transfer fails or is returned, you will need to **use a different bank account** that supports CNH
