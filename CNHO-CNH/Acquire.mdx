### 💸 **Fee Structure**

- **Standard fee**: 0.1% of the amount wired
- **Minimum fee**: CNH ¥20.00
- Fees are deducted from the amount you wired before CNHO is issued.

> For example:\
> If you wire **¥100,000**, the fee is **¥100**, and you will receive CNHO **¥99,900** worth.\
> If you wire **¥5,000**, the minimum fee applies, so you receive **¥4,980** worth of CNHO.
