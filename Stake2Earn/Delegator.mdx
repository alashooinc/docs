## üåê What Is a Delegator on the CNHO Stables Chain?

On the **CNHO Stables Chain**, a _delegator_ is a participant who contributes to the **security and decentralization** of the network by **delegating CNHO tokens to validators**. Delegators are essential to the **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** consensus mechanism, helping maintain the integrity and reliability of the CNHO Stables Chain.

## üÜö Delegator vs. Validator: What‚Äôs the Difference?

| Role          | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Validator** | A node operator responsible for validating transactions, proposing blocks, and securing the chain. Must maintain uptime, performance, and infrastructure. |
| **Delegator** | A token holder who assigns (delegates) their CNHO to a validator to support the network and earn rewards without running a node.                          |

### Key Differences:

- **Responsibility**: Validators operate and maintain infrastructure; delegators do not.
- **Risk**: Validators can be slashed for misbehavior; delegators share in that risk if delegated to them.
- **Rewards**: Both earn staking rewards; validators take a commission from delegators‚Äô rewards.
- **Participation**: Delegators can redelegate or unbond anytime; validators must stay online and follow protocol rules.

## üß† Why Become a Delegator?

By delegating, you:

- **Earn staking rewards** in CNHO tokens
- **Support network security** without technical responsibilities
- Retain **ownership and control** of your tokens (delegation ‚â† transfer)
- Help **govern the CNHO ecosystem** by backing trusted validators

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Become a Delegator

Becoming a delegator on CNHO Stables is simple and requires just a few steps.

### ü™ô Step 1: Hold CNHO Tokens on CNHO Stables Chain

You must have CNHO tokens in a **wallet that supports the CNHO Stables Chain**, such as:

- **Keplr Wallet**
- **Leap Wallet**
- Or any Cosmos-compatible wallet with CNHO Stables chain integration

If your CNHO is on another blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Solana), use the **CNHO deposit function** to bridge funds to the CNHO Stables Chain.

---

### üîç Step 2: Choose a Validator

Navigate to the **CNHO Stables Chain explorer** or staking dashboard (coming soon on [cnho.io](http://cnho.io)) and review available validators.

Key validator metrics to consider:

- Commission rate
- Uptime and performance
- Community reputation
- Governance participation

---

### üîê Step 3: Delegate Your CNHO

Using your wallet:

1. Open the **Staking/Delegate** section
2. Select a validator
3. Enter the **amount of CNHO** you want to delegate
4. Confirm and sign the transaction

‚úÖ Your CNHO stays in your wallet ‚Äî it is only **bonded**, not moved.

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Step 4: Monitor and Manage

- You will **automatically earn staking rewards**
- You can **redelegate** to another validator at any time
- To **unstake**, initiate **unbonding** (usually takes 21 days)

---

## üßæ Notes

- Minimum delegation amount: **1 CNHO**
- Staking rewards frequency: **Every block (~6 seconds)**
- Delegators share both **rewards and risks** with the validator ‚Äî if a validator is slashed (penalized), you may lose a portion of your stake
