#### 1. **Node Uptime Stability**

- Your node machine must run 24/7 with minimal interruptions.
- Daily human intervention is minimal—just check the node status once per day (e.g., in a browser).
- If your node goes offline, it **must be restarted within 24 hours**.
- If a validator misses signing blocks for more than **5 minutes**, it will be marked as "missed blocks".
- Prolonged downtime may result in **slashing penalties** or **automatic jailing**, impacting your rewards.

---

#### 2. **Disable Power Saving & Sleep Modes (Extremely Important)**

To avoid automatic disconnections, **disable the following features** on your system:

- CPU power saving / sleep mode
- HDD/SSD sleep mode
- Network adapter power saving mode (especially on laptops)

It’s highly recommended to run your node on a reliable VPS, physical server, or an always-on desktop machine.

---

#### 3. **Auto-Restart and Monitoring**

Set up an auto-restart daemon using `systemd` or `supervisor`.

Suggested monitoring tools:

- **Prometheus \+ Grafana**
- **Cosmovisor** for automatic upgrades
- **Alerting** via Telegram bot, email, or Uptime Robot

---

#### 4. **Private Key Security & Backup**

- Securely store `priv_validator_key.json`—this is your validator’s signing key.
- **Never upload** it to cloud drives, syncing services, or Git repositories.
- Store multiple encrypted offline backups for safety.

---

#### 5. **Stay Synced with Mainnet**

- Join the official [GitHub](https://github.com/alashooinc/ChainCNHO) or Telegram to stay updated on mainnet upgrades.
- Failing to upgrade during a hard fork will stop your node from producing blocks.
- Check sync status with:

  ```bash
  curl -s localhost:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info 
  ```

---

#### 6. **Log Monitoring & Error Troubleshooting**

To view logs, use:

```bash
journalctl -u cnho_stables -f 
```

- Regularly clean logs to prevent disk overflow.
- Watch for issues such as `out of gas`, `panic`, `disk full`, etc.

---

#### 7. **Enable API / RPC Access**

Edit `app.toml` and `config.toml` to enable:

```bash
api = true swagger = true enable = true  # for RPC 
```

- By default, these services listen on local ports.
- If exposing externally, ensure proper **firewall and security settings**.

---

#### 8. **Node Restart & Jail Recovery**

- **Do not delete** `priv_validator_state.json` before restarting your node.
- If your node is jailed due to downtime, you can unjail it manually with:

  ```bash
  cnho_stables tx slashing unjail --from your-key-name
  ```
