### 1. **Network Transaction Fee Rewards (CNHO)**

Users pay a small amount of CNHO as a transaction fee when transferring funds or interacting on the CNHO Stables network. These fees are distributed to validators and their delegators who participate in the mainnet consensus. The distribution rules are as follows:

- **Validator Commission**: Each validator can set their own commission rate (e.g., 10%, 20%), which they receive as a priority.
- **Delegator Share**: The remaining fees are distributed proportionally based on the amount of CNHO staked by each delegator.

**Terminology**:

- **Validator**: A node operator that runs a full node, produces and validates blocks, and is responsible for maintaining uptime and security.
- **Delegator**: A CNHO holder who stakes their tokens to a validator, helping increase the validator’s voting power in exchange for a share of the rewards.

**Example Calculation**:\
Assume the validator receives 100 CNHO in transaction fees in one day:

- Validator commission is 10% → Validator receives 10 CNHO
- Remaining 90 CNHO is distributed among delegators
- If you staked 5% of the total delegation → You receive: 90 × 5% = **4.5 CNHO**

---

### 2. **CNHO Foundation Subsidy**

To support node operators and encourage active participation in the early phase of the network, the CNHO Foundation provides daily operational subsidies to help cover costs:

- **Subsidy Range**: Approximately 30–100 CNHO per day
- **Distribution Criteria**: Based on uptime and activity of the validator
- **Announcement Method**: Rules and eligible validators are announced periodically in the community

These subsidies serve as an interim reward before transaction fee revenues scale up.

**Example Calculation**:\
Assume your validator receives a 50 CNHO subsidy today:

- The full subsidy goes to the validator and is **not** shared with delegators → You receive: **50 CNHO**

---

### 3. **\$OFO Governance Token Airdrop Rewards**

In addition to CNHO rewards, validators and their delegators are also eligible to receive \$OFO, the governance token, through an ongoing airdrop mechanism:

- A small amount of \$OFO is released with every block
- The rewards are distributed to block-producing validators and their delegators based on stake ratio
- \$OFO is used for future governance, proposal voting, and other community engagement features

**Preliminary Plan**:\
The \$OFO airdrop is expected to begin at **block height 5,000,000**. Details will be announced separately by the Foundation.

**Example Calculation**:\
Assume your delegated validator earns 200 OFO today:

- Validator commission is 20% → Validator receives: 200 × 20% = 40 OFO
- Remaining 160 OFO is distributed to delegators
- If your stake accounts for 2% of the total delegation → You receive: 160 × 2% = **3.2 OFO**
